# Zelda Meme Exit Intent Modal

![Take this it's dangerous to go alone meme for original zelda](/assets/meme.png)

This project was part of my developer [portfolio](https://peterlunch.com/). It is an exit intent modal with the goal of getting a user to download me resume before they leave the page. I used a eme from one of my favourite Zelda games to show my personality/interests and to make it a bit more exciting.

I got great responses to this modal and was asked by many to create a guide. So the purpose of this repo is to give the user the start files needed to follow along with the tutorial [here](https://peterlunch.com/javascript-exit-intent-modal/).

This modal uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Project Installation

Fork the repo and follow along with the tutorial using the files in the root directory. 

The Finished Files directory is there for reference.
